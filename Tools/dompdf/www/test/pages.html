<h1>A Brief History of PostgreSQL</h1>

<p>The object-relational database management system now known as PostgreSQL
is derived from the POSTGRES package written at the University of California
at Berkeley. With over a decade of development behind it, PostgreSQL is now
the most advanced open-source database available anywhere.</p>

<h1>The Berkeley POSTGRES Project</h1>

<p>The POSTGRES project, led by Professor Michael Stonebraker, was sponsored
by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the Army Research
Office (ARO), the National Science Foundation (NSF), and ESL, Inc. The
implementation of POSTGRES began in 1986. The initial concepts for the
system were presented in The design of POSTGRES and the definition of the
initial data model appeared in The POSTGRES data model. The design of the
rule system at that time was described in The design of the POSTGRES rules
system. The rationale and architecture of the storage manager were detailed
in The design of the POSTGRES storage system.  POSTGRES has undergone
several major releases since then. The first "demoware" system became
operational in 1987 and was shown at the 1988 ACM-SIGMOD Conference. Version
1, described in The implementation of POSTGRES, was released to a few
external users in June 1989.</p>

<p>In response to a critique of the first rule system (A commentary on the
POSTGRES rules system), the rule system was redesigned (On Rules,
Procedures, Caching and Views in Database Systems) and Version 2 was
released in June 1990 with the new rule system. Version 3 appeared in 1991
and added support for multiple storage managers, an improved query executor,
and a rewritten rule system. For the most part, subsequent releases until
Postgres95 (see below) focused on portability and reliability.  POSTGRES has
been used to implement many different research and production
applications. These include: a financial data analysis system, a jet engine
performance monitoring package, an asteroid tracking database, a medical
information database, and several geographic information systems. POSTGRES
has also been used as an educational tool at several universities. Finally,
Illustra Information Technologies (later merged into Informix, which is now
owned by IBM.) picked up the code and commercialized it. In late 1992,
POSTGRES became the primary data manager for the Sequoia 2000 scientific
computing project. The size of the external user community nearly doubled
during 1993. It became increasingly obvious that maintenance of the
prototype code and support was taking up large amounts of time that should
have been devoted to database research. In an effort to reduce this support
burden, the Berkeley POSTGRES project officially ended with Version 4.2.  In
1994, Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen added a SQL language interpreter to
POSTGRES. Under a new name, Postgres95 was subsequently released to the web
to find its own way in the world as an open-source descendant of the
original POSTGRES Berkeley code.  Postgres95 code was completely ANSI C and
trimmed in size by 25%. </p>

<p>Many internal changes improved performance and
maintainability. Postgres95 release 1.0.x ran about 30-50% faster on the
Wisconsin Benchmark compared to POSTGRES, Version 4.2. Apart from bug fixes,
the following were the major enhancements:</p>

<p>The query language PostQUEL was replaced with SQL (implemented in the
server). Subqueries were not supported until PostgreSQL (see below), but
they could be imitated in Postgres95 with user-defined SQL
functions. Aggregate functions were re-implemented. Support for the GROUP BY
query clause was also added.</p>

<p>In addition to the monitor program, a new program (psql) was provided for
interactive SQL queries, which used GNU Readline.</p>

<p>A new front-end library, libpgtcl, supported Tcl-based clients. A sample
shell, pgtclsh, provided new Tcl commands to interface Tcl programs with the
Postgres95 server.</p>

<p>The large-object interface was overhauled. The inversion large objects
were the only mechanism for storing large objects. (The inversion file
system was removed.)</p>

<p>The instance-level rule system was removed. Rules were still available as
rewrite rules.</p>

<p>A short tutorial introducing regular SQL features as well as those of
Postgres95 was distributed with the source code</p>

<p>GNU make (instead of BSD make) was used for the build. Also, Postgres95
could be compiled with an unpatched GCC (data alignment of doubles was
fixed).</p>

<h1>PostgreSQL</h1>

<p>By 1996, it became clear that the name "Postgres95" would not stand the
test of time. We chose a new name, PostgreSQL, to reflect the relationship
between the original POSTGRES and the more recent versions with SQL
capability. At the same time, we set the version numbering to start at 6.0,
putting the numbers back into the sequence originally begun by the Berkeley
POSTGRES project.</p>

<p>The emphasis during development of Postgres95 was on identifying and
understanding existing problems in the server code. With PostgreSQL, the
emphasis has shifted to augmenting features and capabilities, although work
continues in all areas.</p>

<p>Details about what has happened in PostgreSQL since then can be found in
Appendix E.</p>
