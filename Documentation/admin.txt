Here is how the structure or accounts and access works!

1. Accounts
	- each website user is called a viewer this is a record in the accountadmin_viewer table
	- accounts are associated with a group (one of 9 regions in AI, or one of 4 regions in Canada)
	- people with accountadmin_access may create accounts
		- there are two levels of permission (either only for the group you are in, or for the whole site, 1=GroupPerm, 2=SitePerm)

2. Access
	- each viewer then has ACCESS to different areas of the site, namely which link appear on the NavBar
	- First there are access categories (admin, positions, regional, etc...)
	- within each of these categories is an ACCESS_GROUP
	- viewers may be associated with many accessGroups.
